# MineSweeperSolver
This is course project for my first semester subject Aartificial Intelligence

All of my code changes are in MyAI.java. All other code files were provided by the professor.

Performance Measure :
->  The performance measure of your agent will be a score calculated based on
number of worlds your agent has completed. Points are awarded to your agent
only if it successfully solves the entire world. Each difficulty has different weight.
->  The game ends when your agent chooses to leave the game or if your agent
uncovers a mine. In either of these cases you'll get a zero.

Environment :
->  Each difficulty has a different dimension and number of mines:
          Beginner: 8 row x 8 column with 10 mines
          Intermediate: 16x16 with 40 mines
          Expert: 16x30 with 99 mines
->  The board begins with 1 random tile already uncovered and presumably safe. Mines are randomly placed throughout the board. 
Your agent dies when it uncovers a mine.

Actuators
->  Your agent has 4 moves:
       (1) The action UNCOVER reveals a covered tile.
       (2) The action FLAG places a flag on a tile.
       (3) The action UNFLAG removes a flag from a tile if that tile has a flag.
       (4) The action LEAVE ends the game immediately.
->  The actions UNCOVER, FLAG, and UNFLAG are to be coupled with a pair of
coordinates which allows the agent to act on a single tile.
Sensors
->  Your agent will receive only one percept:
    ->  Following an UNCOVER action, your argent will perceive the hint
        number associated with the previous UNCOVER action. This number
        represents how many mines are within that tileâ€™s immediate neighbors.
    ->  Following a FLAG or UNFLAG action, your agent will perceive -1.
